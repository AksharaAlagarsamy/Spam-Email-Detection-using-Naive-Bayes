# Spam-Email-Detection-using-Naive-Bayes
Using Naive Bayes for Spam Email Classification uses NLP methodologies such as the Bag of Words technique and TF-IDF to identify whether an incoming email is a spam or a genuine one. The proposed work will make a comparison of how Multinomial Naive Bayes and Gaussian Naive Bayes classify the emails.
Anti-Spam Email Classification using Naive Bayes Classifiers is a machine learning project that focuses on building a spam/non-spam classification system based on the text content of the emails. The project uses various NLP operations such as tokenization, stop word removal, feature extraction with Bag of Words model and TF-IDF vectorization to transform the raw text data from the spam/non-spam emails into valuable numerical data. Two different Naive Bayes classifiers: Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier have been implemented in this project in order to compare them for spam classification efficiency. The project also uses various evaluation parameters for testing the efficiency of spam classifiers like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for spam classification. Graphical representation techniques such as Confusion Matrix & Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve help compare the classification results obtained from both algorithms. The main objective of this project work is to prove the efficiency of Multinomial Naive Bayes for spam classification using text data and also to make a comprehensive use of the Naive Bayes algorithms for spam filtering systems.
